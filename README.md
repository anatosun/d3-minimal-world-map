# D3 Minimal World Map

This map is intended as an exercise for D3.js beginners. They should take the code as a basis and add features such as
- adding non-overlapping colours to countries,
- make a tooltip appear on mouseover with several pieces of information,
- broaden the contours on mouseover or grey out the country.
