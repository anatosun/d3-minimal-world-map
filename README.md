# D3 Minimal World Map

This map is intended as an exercise for D3 beginners. They should take the code as a basis and add features such as
- non-overlapping colours to countries,
- a tooltip on mouseover with several pieces of information,
- broaden the contours on mouseover or grey out the country.
